Nav bar elements - 

Create linking for onClick events in the nav bar

COMPLETED!
  Logo onclick - send to homepage
  coin onclick - send to wallet
  bag onclick - send to cart

NEXT:
Apply logic so user cant add more then one of the same item (unless there is multiple available)
Remove wallet (For this application it simply isnt needed, we will give the user unlimited gold to spend)
Increase map image size when on mobile. (Maybe enlarge on click?)


STRETCH: This is a huge amount of work i feel, so it isnt needed to ship product, but would be really cool!
D20 dice roll with animation. Each side of the dice will apply a random effect to the store (price discount, price increase, etc)
