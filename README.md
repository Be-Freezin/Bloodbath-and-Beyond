# Bloodbath and Beyond

My personal twist on a mini storefront web app. The primary purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in utilizing tools and technologies to create fun, practical and modern applications, in this case, a store front.

The user is able to add items to there cart, delete items from there cart and purchase items (no back end hooked up)

## Technologies Used

React - React is the power house in this project. Allowing my to smoothly create an engaging web experience. Using Reacts component based system, i was able to break my project down into smaller pieces and seamlessly glue them all together for a cohesive experience.

React-Router Dom - Using React-Router-Dom, this allows me to simulate separate "pages" for users to navigate.

React-Scroll - By using react-scroll, this allowed me to give the user a smooth scroll in view effect when they click the the respectable navigation elements. Scrolling each part of the page into view upon click.
